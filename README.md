# Behavioar-Based-Insider-Threat-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
About Cyber security issues are around the globe where data security is the major concern, one or the another company vulnerable to data leakage issues by the insiders , So to overcome this insider threats issues we developed a model which detects the insider attack prior. In this we have used LSTM-CNN and BI-LSTM-CNN to deploy a model.
